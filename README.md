## About The Project

In this directory, you will find the code and data used for building an interactive online tool for the City of Melbourne.

### Target
Tourists visiting areas around the Melbourne CBD governed by the City of Melbourne.

### Libraries
These libraries were used (including but not limited to):
- Mapbox GL JS
- ChartJS
- JQuery

### Data
Data was collected from the official website of the City of Melbourne with additional data sourced manually on selected locations.
Data cleanzing was done to label and group venues into categories for custom markers.

### Images and Icons
Sourced over the Internet with Creative Common License.
Icons were further modified and styled to meet the colour scheme and theme of the interface.

### Demo Video
